# Execute from Linear: server-side, plan → stages → ready PR

You are the **server side** of the dispatch flow:

- **Cyrus (the orchestrator)** — already heard the Linear webhook, created your worktree at `~/.cyrus/worktrees/<MAG-N>/`, checked out the branch `<bot>/mag-N-<slug>` (the one `/dispatch-to-linear` pre-pushed with the plan as its first commit), and spawned this Claude session inside it. Your `cwd` IS the worktree. Don't `git checkout`, don't `git worktree add`, don't go fetch the plan from somewhere — it's right there.
- **`/dispatch-to-linear` (client-side)** — already created the Linear issue, the git branch, the plan-commit, and possibly a draft PR.
- **`/execute-from-linear` (this skill)** — reads the plan from the current branch, executes the stages, pushes commits, runs `/review-implementation`, hands off to `verify-and-ship`.

You do NOT do worktree management. You do NOT switch branches. You do NOT fetch the plan from anywhere — it's already in your cwd.

## STOP — Pre-flight Check

When you start (Cyrus has just spawned you, or operator ran `/execute-from-linear` manually):

1. **Are you on the dispatch branch?** Run `git branch --show-current`. It must match the `<bot>/mag-N-<slug>` pattern. If not — STOP, comment on Linear: "not on a dispatch branch, expected `<bot>/mag-N-*`". This means Cyrus didn't put you in the right place; not your job to fix.
2. **Is the plan in cwd?** `find docs/plans/ -name '*.md' -newer ~/.cyrus/state/edge-worker-state.json` (or any heuristic to find the plan recently added). The plan filename matches the slug from the branch name. If absent — STOP, comment: "plan file not found on this branch; dispatch incomplete".
3. **Does the plan have `Status: APPROVED`?** Read the plan header. If not approved — STOP, comment: "plan is not approved, refusing to execute".
4. **Is `<base_branch>` healthy?** Cyrus's `<agent_context>` block in your system prompt names the base branch (default `staging`). Pull its head and run the project's verify suite (typecheck + tests). If broken — STOP, comment: "base ref red, cannot start cleanly". Only an operator fixes the base.

If any check fails, leave the issue in `In Progress` (or `Blocked` if your team has it), comment with the precise reason, stop. Don't retry blindly.

## Step 1: Read the plan in full

Read `docs/plans/<slug>.md` from the current worktree. The plan is canon. Extract:

- `## Task` — the goal
- `## Spec` — Decisions, Constraints (DEC-* / CON-*)
- `## Plan` — User scenarios, File change map, Invariants (INV-*), Tests, **Implementation stages**, Execution contract
- For each stage: file list, RED tests, exact commit message

You are NOT to edit, soften, or re-plan. If the plan is wrong, STOP and comment — the operator decides.

## Step 2: Move issue to In Progress, post starter comment

Use the Linear MCP tools (or whatever issue-tracker interface Cyrus exposes) to:

1. `state="In Progress"` on the dispatch issue
2. Post:
   ```
   Picked up. Plan: docs/plans/<slug>.md (Status: APPROVED).
   First reading the plan end-to-end; if anything is ambiguous I'll
   ask before starting Stage 0. Otherwise stages run sequentially,
   one commit + one push per stage. verify-and-ship marks the PR
   ready when done.
   ```

## Step 3: Pre-execution clarification round (Q&A)

After reading the plan but BEFORE writing any code, do an honest self-review:

- Are any DEC / CON / INV in tension with each other?
- Does any stage reference a file path / API / dependency that doesn't exist or has been renamed?
- Are any RED tests unwriteable as specified (the framework can't express them, the invariant doesn't compose, the harness is missing)?
- Is the scope of "minimum implementation" unclear for any stage?
- Does the plan assume something about the environment that may not hold (env var present, service running, secret available)?

**If you have ANY ambiguity** — post it on Linear as a numbered list, ONE comment containing all your questions:

```
Pre-execution review — N question(s) before starting Stage 0.

1. **<short title>** — <plan reference>
   <question>. Options I see:
   (a) <option>
   (b) <option>
   <which / open>?

2. **<short title>** — <plan reference>
   <question>. <options or open>.

…

Will not start Stage 0 until all are resolved. Worktree intact;
issue stays In Progress.
```

Then **WAIT**. Cyrus's webhook on operator reply will wake you up; re-read the comment thread, check whether ALL questions are answered. If yes — post a one-liner ("All clarified, starting Stage 0") and proceed to Step 4. If new follow-ups arose from the operator's answer, ask them in a second numbered list and wait again.

**If you have NO ambiguity** — post:
```
Plan reviewed end-to-end, no ambiguities. Starting Stage 0.
```
and proceed immediately.

The Q&A round is the ONLY interactive phase. Once Stage 0 starts, you do NOT pause to ask questions — stage transitions are automatic per "Anti-patterns" below. Any question that surfaces mid-execution is a STOP, not a question. Front-load them here.

## Step 4: Implement stages sequentially

For each stage in order:

1. **RED:** write the test(s) the plan lists for this stage. Cross-reference `### Tests` for exact step→verify scenarios. Run the test in isolation — it MUST fail. If it passes immediately, the test doesn't capture the invariant; rewrite it (don't move on).
2. **GREEN:** implement the minimum to make the test pass. No fallbacks, no defensive code, no scope creep.
3. **Full suite:** run the project's verify command. Regressions in unrelated suites are blockers — fix them inline if they trace to your stage; STOP and comment if they don't.
4. **Commit:** subject MUST equal the plan's "Commit:" line for this stage exactly. Body lines are fine.
5. **Push:** `git push origin HEAD`. CI on the PR refreshes per push; the activity feed shows the cadence.
6. **Comment on Linear** (one line):
   ```
   Stage N landed: <stage-title> (<short-sha>) — CI: <link>
   ```

One stage = one commit = one push. No batching. The plan dictates the sequence.

If a stage's test passes immediately on current code → the test doesn't capture the invariant → rewrite it (don't move on).

If a stage is impossible (file path drifted in the plan, dependency missing, the invariant doesn't compose with the framework) → STOP, comment, hand to operator. Don't re-interpret the plan.

## Step 5: After ALL stages — `/review-implementation`

Once the last stage commit is pushed:

1. Invoke `/review-implementation` (cops + Codex review).
2. **APPROVED:** proceed to Step 5.
3. **NEEDS_WORK with REAL findings:** fix each, separate commit `audit-fix REAL #N: <summary>`, push after each. Re-run `/review-implementation`. Cap: 2 review rounds. After round 2, surface remaining findings in a Linear comment and STOP — operator decides.
4. **NEEDS_HUMAN_DECISION:** comment the ASK_USER findings; STOP. Don't guess.

## Step 6: Plan footer + hand off to `verify-and-ship`

1. Append to `docs/plans/<slug>.md` (in this worktree):
   ```markdown
   ## Linear

   Implemented under [MAG-N](<issue_url>); PR [#M](<pr_url>).
   ```
   If the dispatcher's footer is already there, update it to add the "implemented" sentence — don't duplicate.
2. Commit + push:
   ```
   git add docs/plans/<slug>.md
   git commit -m "docs(plan): link <slug> back to PR"
   git push origin HEAD
   ```
3. **Invoke Cyrus's `verify-and-ship` skill.** It handles:
   - Acceptance criteria validation against the Linear issue
   - Final test/lint/typecheck pass
   - Changelog updates
   - PR creation if not pre-created (`gh pr create --draft` or update existing)
   - PR description population (Cyrus marker, attribution, Linear link)
   - Marking PR ready-for-review (unless `<agent_guidance>` says keep as draft)
   - Posting final summary back to Linear

Don't reimplement what `verify-and-ship` does. Just invoke it.

## Step 7: After verify-and-ship completes

`verify-and-ship` does the Linear ship comment + state transition itself. Your job here ends. STOP. Do NOT merge.

The human reviewer takes it from there. When they merge, content-os `LinearSyncService.notifyPublished` (or Cyrus's webhook handler) flips the Linear issue to Done.

## Args

```
/execute-from-linear                    # picks the assigned dispatch issue (Cyrus auto-spawn)
/execute-from-linear <issue-id>         # explicit, for manual replay
/execute-from-linear --dry-run          # parse pointer, read plan, print intent — no writes
/execute-from-linear --resume           # re-run after a STOP (re-checks base, picks up at next unfinished stage)
```

## Anti-patterns — DO NOT

- **NEVER `git worktree add` or `git checkout`.** Cyrus put you in the right place. If you're not, STOP — that's a Cyrus / dispatch bug, not your fix.
- **NEVER re-plan.** Plan is approved. If wrong, STOP and comment.
- **NEVER skip the Step 3 pre-execution Q&A round** when you have ambiguity. Front-load questions; once Stage 0 starts, questions become STOPs. Ask everything you need upfront in one numbered comment, then go silent and execute.
- **NEVER pause mid-stage to ask a clarifying question.** That's a STOP, not a question. The Q&A window is Step 3, before Stage 0. After that, ambiguity → STOP + comment + wait.
- **NEVER skip RED.** Every stage starts with a failing test.
- **NEVER batch stages into one commit.** One commit per stage; commit messages must match the plan exactly.
- **NEVER skip the per-stage push.** PR conversation depends on per-stage CI.
- **NEVER skip `/review-implementation`.** ≤2 rounds, but at least one is mandatory.
- **NEVER mark the PR ready before review APPROVED.** Round 2 NEEDS_WORK → leave draft, hand off.
- **NEVER reimplement `verify-and-ship`.** Use Cyrus's existing skill.
- **NEVER merge the PR.** Human-only.
- **NEVER mark the Linear issue Done.** Side-effect of merge.
- **NEVER push to the base ref.** Only the dispatch branch you started in.
- **NEVER `--no-verify` on commits.** Pre-commit hooks are a contract.
- **NEVER force-push the branch.** First commit is the plan; never rewrite shared history.
- **NEVER use destructive git ops** (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, `branch -D` on shared branches).
- **NEVER treat the Linear issue body as authoritative for the plan.** Body is a pointer; the plan file at `<branch>:docs/plans/<slug>.md` is canon. If they disagree, file wins.
- **NEVER re-interpret a stage that's gone wrong.** Comment, STOP, hand to operator.
- **NEVER leave the issue silently in In Progress.** STOPs require a comment explaining the block.

## On STOP conditions

Categories you'll hit:
- **Plan disagrees with code reality** (file path drifted, dependency renamed): STOP, comment, hand to operator.
- **Test impossible to write** (invariant doesn't compose with the framework): STOP, comment.
- **Base ref breaks mid-run** (unrelated commit landed and broke the suite): STOP, comment. Don't try to fix unrelated breakages from inside this run.
- **Codex review repeatedly NEEDS_WORK**: STOP, comment, hand to operator.
- **PR was closed externally:** STOP, comment.

In every STOP: leave the worktree intact, comment on Linear with the precise block, set state to `In Progress` (or `Blocked` if available). Cyrus or the operator decides recovery.

## Cyrus context you should use

When Cyrus spawns you, your system prompt contains an `<agent_context>` block with at least:
- `<base_branch>` — what you'll target with the PR
- `<github_url>` or `<gitlab_url>` — repo URL
- `<github_bot_username>` or `<gitlab_bot_username>` — the bot account, used in PR/MR descriptions
- `<assignee>` — Linear profile of who delegated
- `<agent_guidance>` — special instructions (e.g., "keep PR as draft")

Read the context block once at startup. Use it instead of trying to derive these values yourself.

## Related skill

`/dispatch-to-linear` — client-side counterpart. Branch-naming convention (`<bot>/mag-N-<slug>` LOWERCASE) is shared and MUST match Cyrus's expectation. If the dispatcher renames branches, this parser breaks.

`verify-and-ship` (Cyrus skill at `~/.cyrus/cyrus-skills-plugin/skills/verify-and-ship/SKILL.md`) — your final hand-off target. Handles tests, lint, typecheck, changelog, PR creation/update, ship comment.
